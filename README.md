# UAVNET #

This project provides a toolbox to test mobility behaviors or communication protocols for a network of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It was designed to test how UAVs could perform reconnaissance (scanning) missions in a fully decentralized manner, i.e. each UAV takes its own decision regarding its mobility by considering local information only.
